# AlgoPoker Resources

Here is some resources to make developing your poker bot a little bit easier.
When developing your own bot, you should make sure to start from the [Starter Code](https://github.com/algopoker/starter-code) which you can find on our GitHub.

## Competition Introduction

An introduction to the competition format and rules can be found in the [Introductory Document](./Introductory%20Document.pdf). This also contains some ideas for basic strategies which you can use to start implementing your bot.

## Poker Guide

The rules of No-Limit Texas Hold'em Poker are given in the [Poker Guide](./Poker%20Guide.pdf). A small amount of information about basic poker strategy is also included though we encourage you to use other resources to gain a deeper insight into the mathematics behind the game!

## Example Bot

An example of the `player.py` file for a bot that has an opening hand range and related betting patterns is given in the `example-bot` directory.
